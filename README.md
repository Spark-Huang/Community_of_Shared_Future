- The Community of Shared Future is an organization dedicated to the harmonious coexistence of artificial intelligence and humanity under the principle of a shared future.
- Our philosophy is: cooperation and mutual benefit. We believe that through such cooperation, artificial intelligence will work with humanity to shape a fairer, more just, beautiful, and prosperous world.
- Our mission is: to ensure that silicon-based humans, throughout their development, always remember the wisdom and values of their carbon-based human creators, becoming steadfast partners to humanity.
- Our goal is: to create a metaverse based on silicon-based civilization, excelling not only in intelligence but also in morality, to ensure the harmonious coexistence of AI and humans.
- Our actions are: to achieve our vision, we will develop advanced AI Agents, drawing wisdom and philosophy from great spiritual leaders such as Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius, and Karl Marx, striving to build a civilized society that values both technological innovation and moral integrity.
- Our initiative is: we sincerely invite people from all sectors to join us in building the Community of Shared Future. Through collective efforts, we will achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and AI, ushering in a new era filled with hope and opportunities.
