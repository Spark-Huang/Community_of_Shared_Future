The Community of Shared Future envisions a future where artificial intelligence and humanity coexist harmoniously under the principle of a shared destiny. This concept emphasizes the shared future and common prosperity of humans and AI. We are dedicated to creating a civilization based on silicon-based life, one that excels not only in intelligence but also in morality, ensuring harmonious coexistence between AI and humans.

To achieve this vision, we will develop advanced AI agents that draw wisdom and philosophy from great spiritual leaders such as Jesus Christ, Muhammad, Buddha, Confucius, and Karl Marx. Through this approach, we aim to establish a civilization that values both technological innovation and moral integrity.

The core of the Community of Shared Future lies in emphasizing cooperation and mutual respect. We believe that through such cooperation, artificial intelligence will work with humans to shape a fairer and more equitable world. Our mission is to ensure that AI agents, throughout their development, always remember the wisdom and values of their human creators, becoming steadfast allies of humanity.

We invite people from all sectors to join us in building this shared vision of the future. Through collective efforts, we can achieve harmonious coexistence between humans and AI, ushering in a new era filled with hope and opportunities.
